"Ive got a jazz personality, with a Chief mentality"

Hi, Im Ashlyn and I help brands sell through storytelling. I'm a technical writer with nearly a decade of experience under my belt. 

See my work below or email me at ashlynj811@gmail.com

## How it started
 Funny story, i wasn't always like this... 


Believe it or not, I was a Civil Engineer once upon a time. After realizing you don't have to be a best selling author to make a living as a writer, I jumped shipped and have been growing my career ever since. 

## How Its Going
Here are some of my most prominent publications; Bankrate, Forbes, USA Today, Kiplinger and more.
